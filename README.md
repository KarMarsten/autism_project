This is the start of a beautiful project.

The concept is really to determine how and when adults with autism will be more prevalent in our global society.
Currently, we focus on autistic children, but with the increased rate of diagnoses, we may need to review our focus (adults will make up more and more of the autistic community as they age into adulthood.

Key questions:
* Is the global society prepared to increase its knowledge of special needs adults?
* What is the expected increase in autistic adults over the next 5 to 10 years?
* As this is currently (v1) US-specific, are the states and federal government prepared to create an inclusive space?

Currently, I am at v1 (this is all in RStudio and is using CDC data - which is less than desirable).

V2 will be out shortly.
